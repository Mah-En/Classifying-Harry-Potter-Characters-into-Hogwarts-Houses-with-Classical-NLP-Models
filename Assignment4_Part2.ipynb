              "\"\\nM r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were\\nAnd don’t get in a flap!\\n\\nYou’re in safe hands (though I have none)\\n\\nFor I’m a Thinking Cap!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n\\n“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”\\n\\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\\n\\n“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”\\n\\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause —\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.\\n\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\\n\\n“Bones, Susan!”\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\\n\\n“Boot, Terry!”\\n\\n“RAVENCLAW!”\\n\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n\\n“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.\\n\\n“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.\\n\\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\\n\\n“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\\n\\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n\\n“Granger, Hermione!”\\n\\nHer mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\\n\\n“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\\n\\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?\\n\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”\\n\\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”\\n\\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\\n\\nThere weren’t many people left now. “Moon”…, “Nott”…, “Parkinson”…, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks, Sally-Anne”…, and then, at last —\\n\\n“Potter, Harry!”\\n\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\\n\\n“Potter, did she say?”\\n\\n“The Harry Potter?”\\n\\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\n\\n“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, A my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting….So where shall I put you?”\\n\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\\n\\n“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”\\n\\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.\\n\\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\\n\\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”\\n\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\\n\\n“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\n\\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\\n\\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.\\n\\n“Welcome,” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\\n\\n“Thank you!”\\n\\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.\\n\\n“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.\\n\\n“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”\\n\\nHarry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\\n\\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\\n\\n“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.\\n\\n“Can’t you —?”\\n\\n“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”\\n\\n“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”\\n\\n“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\\n\\n“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”\\n\\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.\\n\\n“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”\\n\\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\\n\\n“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.\\n\\n“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\\n\\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding…\\n\\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\\n\\n“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”\\n\\nThe others laughed.\\n\\n“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.\\n\\n“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”\\n\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).\\n\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.\\n\\n“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Percy.\\n\\n“N-nothing.”\\n\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.\\n\\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.\\n\\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”\\n\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.\\n\\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n\\n“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\n\\n“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”\\n\\nDumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\\n\\n“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\\n\\n“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\\n\\n“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.”\\n\\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\\n\\n“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.\\n\\n“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.”\\n\\n“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.\\n\\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n\\n“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!”\\n\\nAnd the school bellowed:\\n\\n“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\\n\\nTeach us something please,\\n\\nWhether we be old and bald\\n\\nOr young with scabby knees,\\n\\nOur heads could do with filling\\n\\nWith some interesting stuff,\\n\\nFor now they’re bare and full of air,\\n\\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\\n\\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\\n\\nBring back what we’ve forgot,\\n\\njust do your best, we’ll do the rest,\\n\\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.”\\n\\n\\n\\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\\n\\n“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”\\n\\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\\n\\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\\n\\n“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.”\\n\\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\\n\\n“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”\\n\\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\\n\\n“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!”\\n\\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\n\\n“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Percy.\\n\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\\n\\n“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.”\\n\\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\\n\\n“Password?” she said.\\n\\n“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\\n\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\\n\\n“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get off, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”\\n\\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\\n\\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\\n\\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\\n\\n\\n\\nT here, look.”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”\\n\\n“Wearing the glasses?”\\n\\n“Did you see his face?”\\n\\n“Did you see his scar?”\\n\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\n\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\\n\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”\\n\\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\\n\\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\n\\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\\n\\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\\n\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\\n\\n“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”\\n\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\\n\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\\n\\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.\\n\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\\n\\n“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\\n\\n“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”\\n\\n“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\\n\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\n\\nHedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\\n\\n\\n\\nDear Harry,\\n\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\\n\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\\n\\nHagrid\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\n\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\\n\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.\\n\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\n\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.\\n\\n“Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.”\\n\\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\\n\\n“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.…I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”\\n\\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead.\\n\\n“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”\\n\\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into the air.\\n\\n“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry.\\n\\nSnape’s lips curled into a sneer.\\n\\n“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”\\n\\nHe ignored Hermione’s hand.\\n\\n“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?”\\n\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\\n\\n“I don’t know, sir.”\\n\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\n\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.\\n\\n“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”\\n\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?”\\n\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\\n\\n“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”\\n\\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.”\\n\\nThings didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\\n\\n“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?”\\n\\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\\n\\n“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n\\n“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.”\\n\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\\n\\n“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.”\\n\\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much?\\n\\n“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”\\n\\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\\n\\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.”\\n\\nHagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\\n\\n“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”\\n\\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\\n\\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\n\\n“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\\n\\n“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\\n\\n“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.”\\n\\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes.\\n\\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.”\\n\\n“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”\\n\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n\\n“But he seemed to really hate me.”\\n\\n“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”\\n\\nYet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\\n\\n“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot — great with animals.”\\n\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\\n\\n\\n\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\n\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\n\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\\n\\n“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date.\\n\\n“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!”\\n\\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\\n\\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Harry?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER NINE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\\n\\n\\n\\nH arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\\n\\n“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.”\\n\\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\\n\\n“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.”\\n\\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\\n\\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\\n\\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\\n\\nHarry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\\n\\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\\n\\n“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh…” His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “…you’ve forgotten something….”\\n\\nNeville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\\n\\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\\n\\n“What’s going on?”\\n\\n“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”\\n\\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\\n\\n“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\\n\\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\\n\\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\\n\\n“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.”\\n\\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\\n\\n“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’”\\n\\n“UP” everyone shouted.\\n\\nHarry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\\n\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years.\\n\\n“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle — three — two —”\\n\\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips.\\n\\n“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and —\\n\\nWHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\\n\\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\\n\\n“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s all right, up you get.”\\n\\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\\n\\n“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”\\n\\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\\n\\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\\n\\n“Did you see his face, the great lump?”\\n\\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\\n\\n“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.\\n\\n“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”\\n\\n“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”\\n\\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\\n\\n“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.\\n\\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\\n\\n“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?”\\n\\n“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!”\\n\\nHarry grabbed his broom.\\n\\n“No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.”\\n\\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\\n\\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.\\n\\n“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!”\\n\\n“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\\n\\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\\n\\n“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.\\n\\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\n\\n“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\n\\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\\n\\n“HARRY POTTER!”\\n\\nHis heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\\n\\n“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “— how dare you — might have broken your neck —”\\n\\n“It wasn’t his fault, Professor —”\\n\\n“Be quiet, Miss Patil —”\\n\\n“But Malfoy —”\\n\\n“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”\\n\\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\\n\\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.\\n\\n“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?”\\n\\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?\\n\\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking confused.\\n\\n“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\\n\\n“In here.”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\\n\\n“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\\n\\n“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.”\\n\\nWood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\\n\\n“Are you serious, Professor?”\\n\\n“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?”\\n\\nHarry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\\n\\n“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.”\\n\\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\\n\\n“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.\\n\\n“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall explained.\\n\\n“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light —speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”\\n\\n“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.…”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\\n\\n“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.”\\n\\nThen she suddenly smiled.\\n\\n“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re joking.”\\n\\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it.\\n\\n“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest house player in about —”\\n\\n“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.”\\n\\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”\\n\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\\n\\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters.”\\n\\n“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”\\n\\n“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school.”\\n\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.”\\n\\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n\\n“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?”\\n\\n“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\\n\\n“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second, who’s yours?”\\n\\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\n\\n“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.”\\n\\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.\\n\\n“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you’re my second?”\\n\\n“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.”\\n\\n“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”\\n\\n“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested.\\n\\n“Excuse me.”\\n\\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n\\n“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.\\n\\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\\n\\n“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —”\\n\\n“Bet you could,” Ron muttered.\\n\\n“— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.”\\n\\n“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Good-bye,” said Ron.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.\\n\\n“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.”\\n\\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.”\\n\\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\\n\\n“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”\\n\\n“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.”\\n\\nHarry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.\\n\\n“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\\n\\nHermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\\n\\n“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.”\\n\\n“Go away.”\\n\\n“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so —”\\n\\nBut what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.\\n\\n“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.\\n\\n“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going to be late.”\\n\\nThey hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.\\n\\n“I’m coming with you,” she said.\\n\\n“You are not.”\\n\\n“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.”\\n\\n“You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loudly.\\n\\n“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. I heard something.”\\n\\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\\n\\n“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\\n\\nIt wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\\n\\n“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.”\\n\\n“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.”\\n\\n“How’s your arm?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.”\\n\\n“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later —”\\n\\n“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.”\\n\\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.\\n\\n“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.”\\n\\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.\\n\\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.\\n\\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\\n\\n“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.\\n\\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.\\n\\n“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”\\n\\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\\n\\n“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably hiding.”\\n\\n“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.\\n\\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\\n\\n“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.\\n\\n“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\\n\\nI — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.”\\n\\n“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.”\\n\\n“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”\\n\\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that.\\n\\n“Let’s go.”\\n\\nIt wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.\\n\\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\\n\\n“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.”\\n\\nPeeves cackled.\\n\\n“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”\\n\\n“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”\\n\\n“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”\\n\\n“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.\\n\\n“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!”\\n\\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.\\n\\n“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re done for! This is the end!”\\n\\nThey could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves’s shouts.\\n\\n“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!”\\n\\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\\n\\n“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”\\n\\n“Say ‘please.’”\\n\\n“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”\\n\\n“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.\\n\\n“All right — please.”\\n\\n“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\\n\\n“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll be okay — get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute. “What?”\\n\\nHarry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\\n\\nThey weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\\n\\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\\n\\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\\n\\nHarry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch.\\n\\nThey fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\\n\\n“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\\n\\n“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\\n\\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again.\\n\\n“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”\\n\\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. “You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on.\\n\\n“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.”\\n\\n“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something.”\\n\\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\\n\\n“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”\\n\\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\\n\\n“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you.\\n\\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something…What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts.\\n\\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHALLOWEEN\\n\\n\\n\\nM alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\\n\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Or both,” said Harry.\\n\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\\n\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\\n\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\n\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\\n\\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\\n\\n\\n\\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\\n\\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\\n\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never even touched one.”\\n\\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.\\n\\n“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.”\\n\\nRon couldn’t resist it.\\n\\n“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the Nimbus.”\\n\\n“What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.”\\n\\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow.\\n\\n“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.\\n\\n“Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?”\\n\\n“A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” he added.\\n\\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion.\\n\\n“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team.…”\\n\\n“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.\\n\\n“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”\\n\\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\n\\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n\\n“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.\\n\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\\n\\nAs seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\\n\\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\\n\\n“Hey, Potter, come down!”\\n\\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.\\n\\n“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall meant…you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”\\n\\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\\n\\n“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.”\\n\\n“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\\n\\n“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?”\\n\\n“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.\\n\\n“Never mind,” said Harry quickly.\\n\\n“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.”\\n\\n“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n\\n“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”\\n\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\\n\\n“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two are the Bludgers.”\\n\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.\\n\\n“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.\\n\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\\n\\n“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?”\\n\\n“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off.\\n\\n“Very good,” said Wood.\\n\\n“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.\\n\\n“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —”\\n\\n“— unless they crack my head open.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.”\\n\\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\\n\\n“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\\n\\n“Well, that’s it any questions?”\\n\\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\\n\\n“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of these.”\\n\\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\n\\nHarry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.\\n\\n“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\\n\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.\\n\\n“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.”\\n\\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat.\\n\\nRon, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.\\n\\n“Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\\n\\n“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”\\n\\n“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.\\n\\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!”\\n\\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.\\n\\n“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!”\\n\\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\\n\\n“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”\\n\\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in tears.\\n\\n“I think she heard you.”\\n\\n“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.”\\n\\nHermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\\n\\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.\\n\\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”\\n\\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\n\\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.\\n\\n“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!”\\n\\nPercy was in his element.\\n\\n“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”\\n\\n“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\\n\\n“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.”\\n\\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.\\n\\n“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”\\n\\n“What about her?”\\n\\n“She doesn’t know about the troll.”\\n\\nRon bit his lip.\\n\\n“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.”\\n\\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\\n\\n“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\\n\\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\\n\\n“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”\\n\\n“Search me.”\\n\\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’s fading footsteps.\\n\\n“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\\n\\n“Can you smell something?”\\n\\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\\n\\nAnd then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\\n\\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\\n\\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\\n\\n“The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”\\n\\n“Good idea,” said Ron nervously.\\n\\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\\n\\n“Yes!”\\n\\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just chained up.\\n\\n“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\\n\\n“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.\\n\\n“Hermione!” they said together.\\n\\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\\n\\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.\\n\\n“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.\\n\\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\\n\\n“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\\n\\n“Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.\\n\\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\\n\\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.\\n\\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.\\n\\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: “Wingardium Leviosa!”\\n\\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\\n\\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\\n\\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\\n\\n“Is it — dead?”\\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said Harry, I think it’s just been knocked out.”\\n\\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\\n\\n“Urgh — troll boogers.”\\n\\nHe wiped it on the troll’s trousers.\\n\\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\n\\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind.\\n\\n“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your dormitory?”\\n\\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\\n\\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\\n\\n“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.”\\n\\n“Miss Granger!”\\n\\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\\n\\n“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.”\\n\\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?\\n\\n“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.”\\n\\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them.\\n\\n“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?”\\n\\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\\n\\n“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.”\\n\\nHermione left.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\\n\\n“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”\\n\\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.\\n\\n“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.\\n\\n“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.”\\n\\n“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. “Mind you, we did save her.”\\n\\n“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him.\\n\\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\n\\n“Pig snout,” they said and entered.\\n\\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.\\n\\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQUIDDITCH\\n\\n\\n\\nA s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\\n\\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.\\n\\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn’t know which was worse — people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\\n\\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\\n\\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\\n\\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.\\n\\n“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”\\n\\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\\n\\n“Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.”\\n\\n“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?”\\n\\n“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.\\n\\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.\\n\\n“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\\n\\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.\\n\\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside – and a horrible scene met his eyes.\\n\\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.\\n\\n“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?”\\n\\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but —\\n\\n“POTTER!”\\n\\nSnape’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\\n\\n“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”\\n\\n“GET OUT! OUT!”\\n\\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\\n\\n“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s the matter?”\\n\\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.\\n\\n“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!”\\n\\nHermione’s eyes were wide.\\n\\n“No — he wouldn’t, she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.”\\n\\n“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?”\\n\\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours – but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to forget.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\\n\\n“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”\\n\\n“I don’t want anything.”\\n\\n“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.\\n\\n“I’m not hungry.”\\n\\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field.\\n\\n“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.”\\n\\n“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\\n\\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).\\n\\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\\n\\n“Okay, men,” he said.\\n\\n“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\n\\n“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”\\n\\n“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.\\n\\n“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.\\n\\n“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were on the team last year.”\\n\\n“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.”\\n\\nHe glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”\\n\\n“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”\\n\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\\n\\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n\\n“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\\n\\n“Mount your brooms, please.”\\n\\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n\\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\\n\\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.\\n\\n“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too —”\\n\\n“JORDAN!”\\n\\n“Sorry, Professor.”\\n\\nThe Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc— no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!”\\n\\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.\\n\\n“Budge up there, move along.”\\n\\n“Hagrid!”\\n\\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.\\n\\n“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?”\\n\\n“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.”\\n\\n“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\\n\\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood’s game plan.\\n\\n“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,” Wood had said. “We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.”\\n\\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\\n\\n“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.\\n\\n“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch?”\\n\\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.\\n\\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch — all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\\n\\nHarry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of speed —\\n\\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.\\n\\n“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors.\\n\\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\\n\\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref! Red card!”\\n\\n“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.\\n\\n“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown the red card and you’re out of the game!”\\n\\n“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.\\n\\nHagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.\\n\\n“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.”\\n\\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\n\\n“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —”\\n\\n“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n“I mean, after that open and revolting foul…”\\n\\n“Jordan, I’m warning you —”\\n\\n“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.”\\n\\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He’d never felt anything like that.\\n\\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts — he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out — and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.\\n\\nLee was still commentating.\\n\\n“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — A no…”\\n\\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\\n\\n“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. “If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his broom…but he can’t have.…”\\n\\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\\n\\n“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” Seamus whispered.\\n\\n“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.”\\n\\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.\\n\\n“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.”\\n\\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.\\n\\n“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“What should we do?”\\n\\n“Leave it to me.”\\n\\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good – every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.\\n\\n“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.\\n\\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape’s robes.\\n\\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know what had happened.\\n\\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.\\n\\n“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.\\n\\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.\\n\\n“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.\\n\\n“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”\\n\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?”\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.\\n\\n“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.”\\n\\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\\n\\n“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.\\n\\n“Fluffy?”\\n\\n“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —”\\n\\n“Yes?” said Harry eagerly.\\n\\n“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That’s top secret, that is.”\\n\\n“But Snape’s trying to steal it.”\\n\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.”\\n\\n“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.\\n\\nThe afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.\\n\\n“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!”\\n\\n“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ know why Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ Nicolas Flamel —”\\n\\n“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?”\\n\\nHagrid looked furious with himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER TWELVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED\\n\\n\\n\\nC hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\\n\\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\\n\\n“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.”\\n\\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\\n\\nIt was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\\n\\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\\n\\n“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.\\n\\n“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”\\n\\n“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.”\\n\\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\\n\\n“WEASLEY!”\\n\\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.\\n\\n“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”\\n\\n“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more. Move along, all of you.”\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.\\n\\n“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get him —”\\n\\n“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”\\n\\n“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.”\\n\\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.\\n\\n“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?”\\n\\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.\\n\\n“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked.\\n\\n“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.”\\n\\n“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.\\n\\n“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”\\n\\n“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”\\n\\n“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”\\n\\n“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Harry added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere.”\\n\\n“I’m sayin’ nothin’, said Hagrid flatly.\\n\\n“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\n\\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.\\n\\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he’d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\n\\n“What are you looking for, boy?”\\n\\n“Nothing,” said Harry.\\n\\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\\n\\n“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!”\\n\\nWishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\\n\\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising they’d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\\n\\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\\n\\n“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find anything.”\\n\\n“And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.”\\n\\n“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work.\\n\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\\n\\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t send me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.”\\n\\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\\n\\n“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\\n\\n“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got some presents!”\\n\\n“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.\\n\\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl.\\n\\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\\n\\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\\n\\n“That’s friendly,” said Harry.\\n\\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\\n\\n“Weird!” he said, ‘What a shape! This is money?”\\n\\n“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?”\\n\\n“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater.”\\n\\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\\n\\n“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.”\\n\\n“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.\\n\\nHis next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.\\n\\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.\\n\\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\\n\\n“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re really rare, and really valuable.”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.\\n\\n“It’s an invisibility cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.”\\n\\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\\n\\n“It is! Look down!”\\n\\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.\\n\\n“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!”\\n\\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:\\n\\n\\n\\nYour father left this in my possession before he died.\\n\\nIt is time it was returned to you.\\n\\nUse it well.\\n\\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.\\n\\n“I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s the matter?”\\n\\n“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?\\n\\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\\n\\n“Merry Christmas!”\\n\\n“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”\\n\\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.\\n\\n“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.”\\n\\n“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. “Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.”\\n\\n“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\\n\\n“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. “I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid — we know we’re called Gred and Forge.”\\n\\n“What’s all this noise?”\\n\\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\\n\\n“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.”\\n\\n“I — don’t — want —” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\\n\\n“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said George. “Christmas is a time for family.”\\n\\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce – and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\\n\\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\\n\\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner.\\n\\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.\\n\\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they’d stolen his prefect badge.\\n\\nIt had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\\n\\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\\n\\nHis father’s…this had been his father’s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\\n\\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.\\n\\nUse it well.\\n\\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.\\n\\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use it alone.\\n\\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.\\n\\n“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\\n\\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.\\n\\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.\\n\\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\\n\\nThey didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be.\\n\\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\\n\\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\\n\\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.\\n\\n“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library Restricted Section.”\\n\\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.”\\n\\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they’d knock right into him — the cloak didn’t stop him from being solid.\\n\\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\\n\\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket – but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\\n\\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\\n\\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.\\n\\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.\\n\\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror’s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\\n\\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air – she and the others existed only in the mirror.\\n\\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.\\n\\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.\\n\\n“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”\\n\\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\\n\\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\\n\\nHow long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.\\n\\n“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\\n\\n“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.\\n\\n“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.”\\n\\n“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating anything?”\\n\\nHarry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\\n\\n“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\\n\\n“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”\\n\\n“No!” Harry hissed. I know it’s here somewhere.”\\n\\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.\\n\\n“It’s here — just here — yes!”\\n\\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.\\n\\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\\n\\n“See?” Harry whispered.\\n\\n“I can’t see anything.”\\n\\n“Look! Look at them all…there are loads of them.…”\\n\\n“I can only see you.”\\n\\n“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”\\n\\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\\n\\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\\n\\n“Look at me!” he said.\\n\\n“Can you see all your family standing around you?”\\n\\n“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m head boy!”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too.”\\n\\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.\\n\\n“Do you think this mirror shows the future?”\\n\\n“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —”\\n\\n“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.”\\n\\n“You’re only holding the Quidditch cup, what’s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.”\\n\\n“Don’t push me —”\\n\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.\\n\\n“Quick!”\\n\\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.\\n\\n“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.”\\n\\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.\\n\\n“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”\\n\\n“No…you go…”\\n\\n“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don’t go back tonight.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?”\\n\\n“You sound like Hermione.”\\n\\n“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”\\n\\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet anyone.\\n\\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\\n\\nExcept —\\n\\n“So — back again, Harry?”\\n\\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.\\n\\n“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”\\n\\n“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\\n\\n“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.”\\n\\n“I didn’t know it was called that, Sir.”\\n\\n“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”\\n\\n“It — well — it shows me my family —”\\n\\n“And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.”\\n\\n“How did you know —?”\\n\\n“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”\\n\\nHarry shook his head.\\n\\n“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”\\n\\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want…whatever we want…”\\n\\n“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\\n\\n“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?”\\n\\nHarry stood up.\\n\\n“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”\\n\\n“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me one more thing, however.”\\n\\n“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”\\n\\n“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”\\n\\nHarry stared.\\n\\n“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.”\\n\\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNICHOLAS FLAMEL\\n\\n\\n\\nD umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\\n\\n“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\\n\\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\\n\\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.\\n\\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\\n\\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\\n\\n“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s exactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”\\n\\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\\n\\n“Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. “When’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.”\\n\\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\\n\\n“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”\\n\\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.…\\n\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”\\n\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\\n\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“Really break your leg,” said Ron.\\n\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”\\n\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\\n\\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville’s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. “What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.\\n\\n“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the library. He said he’d been looking for someone to practice that on.”\\n\\n“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville. “Report him!”\\n\\nNeville shook his head.\\n\\n“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled.\\n\\n“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. “He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.”\\n\\n“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out.\\n\\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\\n\\n“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.”\\n\\nNeville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\\n\\n“Thanks, Harry…I think I’ll go to bed.…D’you want the card, you collect them, don’t you?”\\n\\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\\n\\n“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —”\\n\\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n“I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!”\\n\\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited since they’d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\\n\\n“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\\n\\n“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”\\n\\n“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\\n\\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\\n\\n“I knew it! I knew it!”\\n\\n“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.\\n\\n“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!”\\n\\nThis didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.\\n\\n“The what?” said Harry and Ron.\\n\\n“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look – read that, there.”\\n\\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\\n\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\\n\\n\\n\\n“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”\\n\\n“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”\\n\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\\n\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\\n\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer. \\n\\n\\nAll day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry.\\n\\n“Oy, you! ‘Arry Potter!” shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.\\n\\nHot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people’s shins, and reached him before he’d gone two paces.\\n\\n“I’ve got a musical message to deliver to ‘Arry Potter in person,” he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.\\n\\n“Not here,” Harry hissed, trying to escape.\\n\\n“Stay still!” grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry’s bag and pulling him back.\\n\\n“Let me go!” Harry snarled, tugging.\\n\\nWith a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything.\\n\\nHarry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.\\n\\n“What’s going on here?” came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.\\n\\n“What’s all this commotion?” said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived.\\n\\nLosing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.\\n\\n“Right,” he said, sitting on Harry’s ankles. “Here is your singing valentine:\\n\\n\\n\\nHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,\\n\\nHis hair is as dark as a blackboard,\\n\\nI wish he was mine,\\n\\nhe’s really divine,\\n\\nThe hero who conquered the Dark Lord\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.\\n\\n“Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,” he said, shooing some of the younger students away. “And you, Malfoy —”\\n\\nHarry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he’d got Riddle’s diary.\\n\\n“Give that back,” said Harry quietly.\\n\\n“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” said Malfoy, who obviously hadn’t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry’s own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.\\n\\n“Hand it over, Malfoy,” said Percy sternly.\\n\\n“When I’ve had a look,” said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry.\\n\\nPercy said, “As a school prefect —” but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, “Expelliarmus!” and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.\\n\\n“Harry!” said Percy loudly. “No magic in the corridors. I’ll have to report this, you know!”\\n\\nBut Harry didn’t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, “I don’t think Potter liked your valentine much!”\\n\\nGinny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn’t need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.\\n\\nIt wasn’t until they had reached Professor Flitwick’s class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle’s diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn’t much interested in anything else.\\n\\nHarry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn’t think he could stand Fred and George singing, “His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle’s diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.\\n\\nHarry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.\\n\\nThe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, “My name is Harry Potter.”\\n\\nThe words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened.\\n\\nOozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written.\\n\\n“Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?”\\n\\nThese words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back.\\n\\n“Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.”\\n\\nHe waited eagerly for Riddle’s reply.\\n\\n“Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.\\n\\n`I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”\\n\\n“That’s where I am now,” Harry wrote quickly. “I’m at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff’s been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?”\\n\\nHis heart was hammering. Riddle’s reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\\n\\n“Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person who’d opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned.”\\n\\nHarry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\\n\\n“It’s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who’s behind them. Who was it last time?”\\n\\n“I can show you, if you like, “came Riddle’s reply. “You don’t have to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him.”\\n\\nHarry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else’s memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.\\n\\n“Let me show you.”\\n\\nHarry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.\\n\\nOK\\n\\nThe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.\\n\\nHe felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.\\n\\nHe knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore’s office — but it wasn’t Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” he said shakily. “I didn’t mean to butt in —”\\n\\nBut the wizard didn’t look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, “Er — I’ll just go, shall I?”\\n\\nStill the wizard ignored him. He didn’t seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.\\n\\n“Sorry I disturbed you. I’ll go now,” he half-shouted.\\n\\nThe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.\\n\\nThe sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.\\n\\nHarry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix — no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.\\n\\nThere was a knock on the office door.\\n\\n“Enter,” said the old wizard in a feeble voice.\\n\\nA boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect’s badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.\\n\\n“Ah, Riddle,” said the Headmaster.\\n\\n“You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?” said Riddle. He looked nervous.\\n\\n“Sit down,” said Dippet. “I’ve just been reading the letter you sent me.”\\n\\n“Oh,” said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.\\n\\n“My dear boy,” said Dipper kindly, “I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?”\\n\\n“No,” said Riddle at once. “I’d much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that — to that —”\\n\\n“You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?” said Dippet curiously.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Riddle, reddening slightly.\\n\\n“You are Muggle-born?”\\n\\n“Half-blood, sir,” said Riddle. “Muggle father, witch mother.”\\n\\n“And are both your parents —?”\\n\\n“My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me — Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.”\\n\\nDipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.\\n\\n“The thing is, Tom,” he sighed, “Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances…”\\n\\n“You mean all these attacks, sir?” said Riddle, and Harry’s heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\\n\\n“Precisely,” said the headmaster. “My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy… the death of that poor little girl… You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the — er — source of all this unpleasantness…”\\n\\nRiddle’s eyes had widened.\\n\\n“Sir — if the person was caught — if it all stopped —”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. “Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?”\\n\\n“No, sir,” said Riddle quickly.\\n\\nBut Harry was sure it was the same sort of “no” that he himself had given Dumbledore.\\n\\nDippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.\\n\\n“You may go, Tom…”\\n\\nRiddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him.\\n\\nDown the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\\n\\nThen, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn’t see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase.\\n\\n“What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?”\\n\\nHarry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year-younger Dumbledore.\\n\\n“I had to see the headmaster, sir,” said Riddle.\\n\\n“Well, hurry off to bed,” said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. “Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since…”\\n\\nHe sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.\\n\\nBut to Harry’s disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn’t been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.\\n\\nIt felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door.\\n\\nSomeone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn’t be heard.\\n\\nFor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper.\\n\\n“C’mon…gotta get yeh outta here…C’mon now…in the box…”\\n\\nThere was something familiar about that voice…\\n\\nRiddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.\\n\\n“Evening, Rubeus,” said Riddle sharply.\\n\\nThe boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\\n\\n“What yer doin’ down here, Tom?”\\n\\nRiddle stepped closer.\\n\\n“It’s all over,” he said. “I’m going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They’re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don’t stop.”\\n\\n“‘N at d’yeh —”\\n\\n“I don’t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don’t make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and —”\\n\\n“It never killed no one!” said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.\\n\\n“Come on, Rubeus,” said Riddle, moving yet closer. “The dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered…”\\n\\n“It wasn’t him!” roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. “He wouldn’! He never!”\\n\\n“Stand aside,” said Riddle, drawing out his wand.\\n\\nHis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone.\\n\\nA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers — Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, “NOOOOOO!”\\n\\nThe scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle’s diary lying open on his stomach.\\n\\nBefore he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in.\\n\\n“There you are,” he said.\\n\\nHarry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\\n\\n“What’s up?” said Ron, looking at him with concern.\\n\\n“It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHP 2 - Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCORNELIUS FUDGE\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d christened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he’d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He’d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody.\\n\\nHarry half wished he hadn’t found out how to work Riddle’s diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he’d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.\\n\\n“Riddle might have got the wrong person,” said Hermione. “Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people…”\\n\\n“How many monsters d’you think this place can hold?” Ron asked dully.\\n\\n“We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,” said Harry miserably. “And the attacks must’ve stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn’t have got his award.”\\n\\nRon tried a different tack.\\n\\n“Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?”\\n\\n“But the monster had killed someone, Ron,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I don’t blame him for wanting to stay here…”\\n\\n“You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you, Harry?”\\n\\n“He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said Harry quickly.\\n\\nThe three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\\n\\n“Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?”\\n\\n“That’d be a cheerful visit,” said Ron. “‘Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?’”\\n\\nIn the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his “Oh, Potter, you rotter” song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy.\\n\\n“The moment they start trying to move into each other’s pots, we’ll know they’re fully mature,” she told Harry. “Then we’ll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.\\n\\n“…it could affect our whole future,” she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.\\n\\n“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry.\\n\\n“We can’t,” said Ron gloomily. “We keep all our old subjects, or I’d’ve ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.”\\n\\n“But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked.\\n\\n“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.”\\n\\nNeville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody’s advice but signed up for everything.\\n\\nHarry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn’t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience.\\n\\n“Depends where you want to go, Harry,” he said. “It’s never too early to think about the future, so I’d recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they’re thinking of working in close contact with them — look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.”\\n\\nBut the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.\\n\\n\\n\\nGryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday’s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor’s chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better.\\n\\nBut his cheerful mood didn’t last long. At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.\\n\\n“Harry — I don’t know who did it — I just found —”\\n\\nWatching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.\\n\\nThe contents of Harry’s trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.\\n\\nHarry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly.\\n\\n“What happened, Harry?”\\n\\n“No idea,” said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry’s robes. All the pockets were hanging out.\\n\\n“Someone’s been looking for something,” said Ron. “Is there anything missing?”\\n\\nHarry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn’t there.\\n\\n“Riddle’s diary’s gone,” he said in an undertone to Ron.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\nHarry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.\\n\\nHermione looked aghast at the news.\\n\\n“But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody else knows our password —”\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Harry.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze.\\n\\n“Perfect Quidditch conditions!” said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team’s plates with scrambled eggs. “Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.”\\n\\nHarry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle’s diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn’t like the idea. He’d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He didn’t want to be the one who brought it all up again.\\n\\nAs he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry’s growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again.\\n\\n“Kill this time…let me rip…tear…”\\n\\nHe shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm.\\n\\n“The voice!” said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. “I just heard it again — didn’t you?”\\n\\nRon shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead.\\n\\n“Harry — I think I’ve just understood something! I’ve got to go to the library!”\\n\\nAnd she sprinted away, up the stairs.\\n\\n“What does she understand?” said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from.\\n\\n“Loads more than I do,” said Ron, shaking his head.\\n\\n“But why’s she got to go to the library?”\\n\\n“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.”\\n\\nHarry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.\\n\\n“You’d better get moving,” said Ron. “It’s nearly eleven — the match —”\\n\\nHarry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.\\n\\nThe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.\\n\\nHarry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.\\n\\nHarry’s heart dropped like a stone.\\n\\n“This match has been cancelled,” Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick.\\n\\n“But, Professor!” he shouted. “We’ve got to play — the cup — Gryffindor —”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone:\\n\\n“All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information. As quickly as you can, please!”\\n\\nThen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.\\n\\n“Potter, I think you’d better come with me….”\\n\\nWondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry’s surprise, Professor McGonagall didn’t object.\\n\\n“Yes, perhaps you’d better come, too, Weasley…”\\n\\nSome of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. But they weren’t taken to anybody’s office this time.\\n\\n“This will be a bit of a shock,” said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. “There has been another attack … another double attack.”\\n\\nHarry’s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered. . Madam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they’d accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to her was —\\n\\n“Hermione!” Ron groaned.\\n\\nHermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.\\n\\n“They were found near the library,” said Professor McGonagall. “I don’t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to them…”\\n\\nShe was holding up a small, circular mirror.\\n\\nHarry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.\\n\\n“I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Professor McGonagall heavily. “I need to address the students in any case.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“All students will return to their House common rooms by six o’clock in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.”\\n\\nThe Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, “I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.”\\n\\nShe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately.\\n\\n“That’s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, “ said the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan, counting on his fingers. “Haven’t any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn’t it obvious all this stuff’s coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin — why don’t they just chuck all the Slytherins out?” he roared, to nods and scattered applause.\\n\\nPercy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn’t seem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.\\n\\n“Percy’s in shock,” George told Harry quietly. “That Ravenclaw girl — Penelope Clearwater — she’s a prefect. I don’t think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.”\\n\\nBut Harry was only half-listening. He didn’t seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if the culprit wasn’t caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.\\n\\n“What’re we going to do?” said Ron quietly in Harry’s ear. “D’you think they suspect Hagrid?”\\n\\n“We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said Harry, making up his mind. “I can’t believe it’s him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he’ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.”\\n\\n“But McGonagall said we’ve got to stay in our tower unless we’re in class —”\\n\\n“I think,” said Harry, more quietly still, “it’s time to get my dad’s old cloak out again.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves.\\n\\nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn’t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open.\\n\\nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid’s house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door.\\n\\nSeconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him.\\n\\n“Oh,” he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. “What’re you two doin’ here?”\\n\\n“What’s that for?” said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside.\\n\\n“Nothin’ — nothin’ —” Hagrid muttered. “I’ve bin expectin’ — doesn’ matter — Sit down — I’ll make tea —”\\n\\nHe hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.\\n\\n“Are you okay, Hagrid?” said Harry. “Did you hear about Hermione?”\\n\\n“Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.\\n\\nHe kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door.\\n\\nHagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and \""
